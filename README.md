# Beer-Roulette
A Tool to Help Beer Enthusiasts Select a Random Beer to Try

This project was designed to merge my love of craft beer and my quest to learn to code.
I made this version of Beer Roulette for me and I hope to keep improving it by adding more beer types 
and images as I go along.
This project could also be for you.
Are you strictly a fan of domestic beers? Switch them all out for what you want.
Do you live in Ireland? Change the beers for more available options (I got you started with Bulmers).
